# Scripts Folder

Hey, me! Please document your scripts here so they don't confuse you later

This folder is for general purpose scripts. Nautilus scripts (callable from file browser) are found in `~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/`

## Scripts

`start_blender_with_cuda.sh` - script to launch blender with cuda options. Since this is only done with CLI options, this script prevents me from having to type it out each time. This script is referenced by Blender's GNOME .desktop file. I honestly don't know where off the dome, but its googleable

`./gitignore` folder of common gitignore files, referenced by a nautilus script

`pman.sh` show man pages as pdf. Useful when you're tired of staring at pagers
